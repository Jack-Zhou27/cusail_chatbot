Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) consists of using digital signals of varying duty cyles to approximate analog voltage values, which can vary between 0 volts and some maximum voltage rather than simply being high (1) or low (0). *Duty cycle* refers to the percentage of time that a signal is held high (see figure below). To achieve this approximation, a frequency of ~100 Hz or greater is required. PWM is used to control the position of the servo motors.
