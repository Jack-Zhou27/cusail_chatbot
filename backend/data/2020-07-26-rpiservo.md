Raspberry Pis support software PWM, so any GPIO pin can be used to control a servo. Import the GPIO library and set the pin you've chosen for the servo as an output:

<pre>
<code class="python">
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)

</code>
</pre>

You'll need to know the pulse frequency that your servo expects and the range of pulse durations that it supports. For example, an SG90 microservo expects a pulse frequency of 50 Hz and has a range of motion of 180 degrees with a 0.5 ms pulse corresponding to 0 degrees and a 2.5 ms pulse corresponding to 180 degrees. To setup PWM on your pin, use this command, which returns a PWM instance that you'll use later:

<pre>
<code class="python">
pwm = GPIO.PWM(pin, frequency) # frequency is in Hz

</code>
</pre>

Now, let's convert our pulse durations into duty cycles. Remember that the duty cycle is the percentage of the pulse cycle time (20 ms for a 50 Hz pulse) during which the pin is high. For example, pulse duration of 1 ms corresponds to a duty cycle of 5 when the frequency is 50 Hz (0.001 s * 50 Hz * 100 = 5%). To start PWM output with some initial duty cycle, use this command:

<pre>
<code class="python">
pwm.start(dutyCycle)   # 0.0 <= dutyCycle <= 100.0

</code>
</pre>

To change the duty cycle / set a new angle, use this command:

<pre>
<code class="python">
pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(dutyCycle)  # 0.0 <= dutyCycle <= 100.0

</code>
</pre>

When you are done with your servo, stop the PWM output and release the pin(s) you used:

<pre>
<code class="python">
pwm.stop()
GPIO.cleanup()

</code>
</pre>

Here's a script you can use to test servo functionality. This is configured for an SG90 servo on pin 11 (GPIO 17), but you can change the frequency and/or duty cycles for compatibility with any servo. Run this via terminal and stop it using control+C.

<pre>
<code class="python">
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

servoPIN = 11
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(servoPIN, GPIO.OUT)

p = GPIO.PWM(servoPIN, 50) # GPIO 17 for PWM with 50Hz
p.start(2.5) # Initialization
try:
  while True:
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(7.5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(10)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(12.5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(10)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(7.5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    p.ChangeDutyCycle(2.5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
  p.stop()
  GPIO.cleanup()
