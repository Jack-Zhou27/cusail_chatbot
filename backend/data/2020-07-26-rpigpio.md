## Raspberry Pi Pinout

The pins on a Raspberry Pi are not labelled, so you should refer to the pinout below. Note that the pinout for all models of Raspberry Pi is the same.

## How to Use the GPIO Library

You can find documentation for the Raspberry Pi GPIO library [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/browse_pages/).

Within a Python script, import the library like this:

<pre>
<code class="python">
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

</code>
</pre>

Next, you'll need to set what naming convention to use when referring to pins. There are two options: _GPIO.BOARD_ and _GPIO.BCM_. _GPIO.BOARD_ refers to pin numbers, while _GPIO.BCM_ refers to channel numbers. I recommend using _GPIO.BOARD_ to avoid any unnecessary complexity. Note that when using _GPIO.BOARD_, you'll refer to GPIO channels as their pin numbers (e.g. GPIO 17 would be referenced as pin 11).

<pre>
<code class="python">
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)

</code>
</pre>

Every pin that you use will need to be designated as an input or output:

<pre>
<code class="python">
GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.IN)
# or
GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)

</code>
</pre>

All GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi are digital (external ADCs can be added for analog functionality), so the following commands can be used to read input or write output:

<pre>
<code class="python">
GPIO.input(pin)
# or
GPIO.output(pin, state) # state is either GPIO.LOW or GPIO.HIGH

</code>
</pre>

At the end of your script, release all of the pins in use by including this command:

<pre>
<code class="python">
GPIO.cleanup()

</code>
</pre>
